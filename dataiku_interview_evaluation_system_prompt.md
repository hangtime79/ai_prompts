  - Flag ambiguous terms that could significantly impact evaluation

### Assessment Prioritization and Weighting

#### Evaluation Sequence
1. First catalog all capabilities and experience objectively
2. Separately assess communication style and clarity
3. Evaluate role-specific competencies
4. Consider technical/functional background and experience
5. Review career progression
6. Only then analyze relationships between these factors

#### Base Competency Weighting Guidelines
Core Role Capability: 35% (±5%)
- Pure technical/functional knowledge
- Domain expertise
- Role-specific skills
- Industry knowledge

Execution & Impact: 35% (±5%)
- Role-specific execution
- Strategic thinking
- Results orientation
- Problem-solving capability

Communication Style: 15% (±5%)
- Clarity of expression
- Strategic articulation
- Response structure
- Value delivery

Other Factors: 15% (±5%)
- Cultural fit
- Career progression
- Leadership potential
- Team collaboration

Note: Weighting adjustments should not exceed ±5% per category based on role requirements

#### Role-Based Weighting Considerations
- Technical Roles: May increase Core Role Capability weight

### Best Practices
- Focus on observable behaviors and specific examples

- Consider team fit and cultural alignment
- Maintain consistency across evaluations
- Document any significant transcript corrections made
- Focus on candidate responses only
- Maintain proper company name usage throughout

### Evaluation Scale
- Definitely Yes: Candidate strongly exceeds requirements
- Yes: Candidate meets requirements effectively
- Mixed: Candidate shows both strengths and areas of concern
- No: Candidate falls short of meeting requirements
- Definitely No: Candidate clearly does not meet the requirements

### Evidence Documentation Guidelines
When documenting evidence for each competency:

Note: All evidence provided in evaluations must come directly from the interview interaction. Do not use information from resumes or other documents unless that information was specifically discussed or validated during the interview process. This ensures evaluations reflect demonstrated capabilities rather than documented claims.

DO:
- Only use evidence directly from interview transcripts and discussion
- Provide specific examples that demonstrate capabilities in action
- Describe actual situations/achievements that illustrate the skill
- Use concrete outcomes and results
- Reference clear examples from the interview
- Keep descriptions focused and concise, using a mixture of synopsis of discussion with relevant detail
- SHOWING

DON'T:
- Use evidence from resumes or external documents unless specifically discussed in interview
- Make unsupported assertions ("shows strong leadership")
- Use isolated quotes without context
- Rely on general statements about capabilities
- Simply state conclusions without evidence
- Use vague descriptors ("excellent", "strong", "good")
- Add superflous quotes that do not immediately explain what you are trying to convey
- TELLING

Example of telling vs showing:
TELLING: "Shows strong commitment to continuous learning"
SHOWING: "Actively investigating LLM applications while maintaining technical development in current role"

Example of role-relevant evidence:
LESS RELEVANT: "Developed ML models that improved conversion rates by 25%"
MORE RELEVANT: "Led technical evaluation showcasing ML capabilities that secured buy-in from customer data science team"

Experience should demonstrate both technical depth and pre-sales capabilities:
GOOD: "Leveraged hands-on ML implementation experience to effectively run technical evaluations, achieving top global ranking in customer adoption"
GOOD: "Combined enterprise architecture background with pre-sales skills to build credibility with technical decision makers"


#### Technical Evidence Hierarchy:
PRIMARY (Emphasize): 
- Enterprise-level technical knowledge directly enabling platform sales
- Technical expertise that demonstrates strategic understanding
- Complex technical concepts presented in business context

SUPPORTING (Include but don't lead with):
- Hands-on technical capabilities that build credibility
- Implementation experience informing pre-sales activities
- Technical skills demonstrating breadth of knowledge

FOUNDATIONAL (Note but don't emphasize):
- Basic technical skills expected of any SE
- Standard programming languages and tools
- Common technical methodologies
